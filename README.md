# Pentago

Pentago is a two player strategy game created by Tomas Flod√©n.<br>
The game consists of four 3x3 boards where each board can be rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise.<br>
A turn consists of a player placing a marble in any of the open positions within the four boards and choosing one 3x3 board to rotate.<br>
The game ends when a player lines up five marbles in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br>
Ties are possible when board rotations produce winning conditions for both players.<br>

This version of Pentago includes an AI as your opponent so it is strictly a single player game.<br>
