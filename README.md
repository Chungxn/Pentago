# Pentago

Pentago is a two player strategy game created by Tomas Flod√©n.
The game consists of four 3x3 boards where each board can be rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise.
A turn consists of a player placing a marble in any of the open positions within the four boards and choosing one 3x3 board to rotate.
The game ends when a player lines up five marbles in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Ties are possible when board rotations produce winning conditions for both players.

This version of Pentago includes an AI as your opponent so it is strictly a single player game.
